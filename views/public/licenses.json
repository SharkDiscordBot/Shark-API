Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).

The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

    "description": "Extra assertions on top of node's assert module",
    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "# assert-plus\n\nThis library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two\nthings: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable\nNODE\\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like\n`assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks\nlike this:\n\n```javascript\n    var assert = require('assert-plus');\n\n    function fooAccount(options, callback) {\n        assert.object(options, 'options');\n        assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');\n        assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');\n        assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');\n        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');\n        assert.func(callback, 'callback');\n\n        // Do stuff\n        callback(null, {});\n    }\n```\n\n# API\n\nAll methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to\ntake an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`\nwill be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:\n\n    AssertionError: foo (string) is required\n    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)\n    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)\n    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)\n    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)\n    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)\n    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)\n\nfrom:\n\n```javascript\n    function test(foo) {\n        assert.string(foo, 'foo');\n    }\n```\n\nThere you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:\n\n```javascript\n    function test(foo) {\n        assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');\n    }\n```\n\nYou can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):\n\n```javascript\n    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');\n```\n\nLastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the\nenvironment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have\nlots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in\nproduction.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are\nalso disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from\nthe `assert` module avoids this behavior.\n\nThe complete list of APIs is:\n\n* assert.array\n* assert.bool\n* assert.buffer\n* assert.func\n* assert.number\n* assert.finite\n* assert.object\n* assert.string\n* assert.stream\n* assert.date\n* assert.regexp\n* assert.uuid\n* assert.arrayOfArray\n* assert.arrayOfBool\n* assert.arrayOfBuffer\n* assert.arrayOfFunc\n* assert.arrayOfNumber\n* assert.arrayOfFinite\n* assert.arrayOfObject\n* assert.arrayOfString\n* assert.arrayOfStream\n* assert.arrayOfDate\n* assert.arrayOfRegexp\n* assert.arrayOfUuid\n* assert.optionalArray\n* assert.optionalBool\n* assert.optionalBuffer\n* assert.optionalFunc\n* assert.optionalNumber\n* assert.optionalFinite\n* assert.optionalObject\n* assert.optionalString\n* assert.optionalStream\n* assert.optionalDate\n* assert.optionalRegexp\n* assert.optionalUuid\n* assert.optionalArrayOfArray\n* assert.optionalArrayOfBool\n* assert.optionalArrayOfBuffer\n* assert.optionalArrayOfFunc\n* assert.optionalArrayOfNumber\n* assert.optionalArrayOfFinite\n* assert.optionalArrayOfObject\n* assert.optionalArrayOfString\n* assert.optionalArrayOfStream\n* assert.optionalArrayOfDate\n* assert.optionalArrayOfRegexp\n* assert.optionalArrayOfUuid\n* assert.AssertionError\n* assert.fail\n* assert.ok\n* assert.equal\n* assert.notEqual\n* assert.deepEqual\n* assert.notDeepEqual\n* assert.strictEqual\n* assert.notStrictEqual\n* assert.throws\n* assert.doesNotThrow\n* assert.ifError\n\n# Installation\n\n    npm install assert-plus\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."

    "licenseText": "## FileList\n\nA FileList is a lazy-evaluated list of files. When given a list\nof glob patterns for possible files to be included in the file\nlist, instead of searching the file structures to find the files,\na FileList holds the pattern for latter use.\n\nThis allows you to define a FileList to match any number of\nfiles, but only search out the actual files when then FileList\nitself is actually used. The key is that the first time an\nelement of the FileList/Array is requested, the pending patterns\nare resolved into a real list of file names.\n\n### Usage\n\nAdd files to the list with the `include` method. You can add glob\npatterns, individual files, or RegExp objects. When the Array\nmethods are invoked on the FileList, these items are resolved to\nan actual list of files.\n\n```javascript\nvar fl = new FileList();\nfl.include('test/*.js');\nfl.exclude('test/helpers.js');\n```\n\nUse the `exclude` method to override inclusions. You can use this\nwhen your inclusions are too broad.\n\n### Array methods\n\nFileList has lazy-evaluated versions of most of the array\nmethods, including the following:\n\n* join\n* pop\n* push\n* concat\n* reverse\n* shift\n* unshift\n* slice\n* splice\n* sort\n* filter\n* forEach\n* some\n* every\n* map\n* indexOf\n* lastIndexOf\n* reduce\n* reduceRight\n\nWhen you call one of these methods, the items in the FileList\nwill be resolved to the full list of files, and the method will\nbe invoked on that result.\n\n### Special `length` method\n\n`length`: FileList includes a length *method* (instead of a\nproperty) which returns the number of actual files in the list\nonce it's been resolved.\n\n### FileList-specific methods\n\n`include`: Add a filename/glob/regex to the list\n\n`exclude`: Override inclusions by excluding a filename/glob/regex\n\n`resolve`: Resolve the items in the FileList to the full list of\nfiles. This method is invoked automatically when one of the array\nmethods is called.\n\n`toArray`: Immediately resolves the list of items, and returns an\nactual array of filepaths.\n\n`clearInclusions`: Clears any pending items -- must be used\nbefore resolving the list.\n\n`clearExclusions`: Clears the list of exclusions rules."

Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,\r\nroyalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\na) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;\r\n\r\nb) to prepare derivative works (\"Derivative Works\") based upon the Original\r\nWork;\r\n\r\nc) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the\r\npublic;\r\n\r\nd) to perform the Original Work publicly; and\r\n\r\ne) to display the Original Work publicly.\r\n\r\n2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,\r\nroyalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent\r\nclaims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original\r\nWork as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the\r\nOriginal Work and Derivative Works.\r\n\r\n3) Grant of Source Code License. The term \"Source Code\" means the preferred\r\nform of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available\r\ndocumentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby\r\nagrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original\r\nWork along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.\r\nLicensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a\r\nmachine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository\r\nreasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as\r\nlong as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing\r\nthe address of that information repository in a notice immediately following\r\nthe copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.\r\n\r\n4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names\r\nof any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or\r\nservice marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this\r\nOriginal Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing\r\nin this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights,\r\npatents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as\r\nexpressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or\r\noffer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims\r\ndefined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if\r\nsuch marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be\r\ninterpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this\r\nLicense any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to\r\nlicense.\r\n\r\n5) This section intentionally omitted.\r\n\r\n6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative\r\nWorks that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the\r\nSource Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any\r\ndescriptive text identified therein as an \"Attribution Notice.\" You must cause\r\nthe Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent\r\nAttribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have\r\nmodified the Original Work.\r\n\r\n7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that\r\nthe copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein\r\nby Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms\r\nof this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights\r\nand patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding\r\nsentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an \"AS IS\" BASIS\r\nand WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,\r\nthe warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.\r\nThis DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No\r\nlicense to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.\r\n\r\n8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,\r\nwhether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the\r\nLicensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,\r\nor consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License\r\nor the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss\r\nof goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\nother commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not\r\napply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's\r\nnegligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some\r\njurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\r\nconsequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\r\n\r\n9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or\r\na Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to\r\nobtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing\r\nelse but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)\r\ngrants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work\r\nor to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt\r\nto do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement\r\nbetween Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the\r\nequivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by\r\nexercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate\r\nYour acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.\r\n\r\n10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically\r\nand You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License\r\nas of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,\r\nagainst Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a\r\npatent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging\r\npatent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or\r\nhardware.\r\n\r\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this\r\nLicense may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the\r\nLicensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under\r\nthe laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The\r\napplication of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International\r\nSale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the\r\nscope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the\r\nrequirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Â§ 101 et\r\nseq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This\r\nsection shall survive the termination of this License.\r\n\r\n12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or\r\nseeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to\r\nrecover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable\r\nattorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including\r\nany appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this\r\nLicense.\r\n\r\n13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning\r\nthe subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\r\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to\r\nmake it enforceable.\r\n\r\n14) Definition of \"You\" in This License. \"You\" throughout this License, whether\r\nin upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights\r\nunder, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal\r\nentities, \"You\" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is\r\nunder common control with you. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means\r\n(i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such\r\nentity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent\r\n(50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such\r\nentity.\r\n\r\n15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise\r\nrestricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not\r\nto interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.\r\n\r\nThis license is Copyright (C) 2003-2004 Lawrence E. Rosen. All rights reserved.\r\nPermission is hereby granted to copy and distribute this license without\r\nmodification.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

This is useful\nif you're looking to omit certain operations from application bundles. See [Omitting built-in operations](#omitting-built-in-operations) for more info.\n\n```javascript\nimport { createQueryTester, $eq, $in } from \"sift\";\nconst filter = createQueryTester({ $eq: 5 }, { operations: { $eq, $in } });\n```\n\n### createEqualsOperation(params: any, ownerQuery: Query, options: Options): Operation\n\nUsed for [custom operations](#custom-operations).\n\n```javascript\nimport { createQueryTester, createEqualsOperation, $eq, $in } from \"sift\";\nconst filter = createQueryTester(\n  { $mod: 5 },\n  {\n    operations: {\n      $something(mod, ownerQuery, options) {\n        return createEqualsOperation(\n          value => value % mod === 0,\n          ownerQuery,\n          options\n        );\n      }\n    }\n  }\n);\nfilter(10); // true\nfilter(11); // false\n```\n\n## Supported Operators\n\nSee MongoDB's [advanced queries](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Advanced+Queries) for more info.\n\n### \\$in\n\narray value must be _\\$in_ the given query:\n\nIntersecting two arrays:\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: ['Brazil']\n[\"Brazil\", \"Haiti\", \"Peru\", \"Chile\"].filter(\n  sift({ $in: [\"Costa Rica\", \"Brazil\"] })\n);\n```\n\nHere's another example. This acts more like the \\$or operator:\n\n```javascript\n[{ name: \"Craig\", location: \"Brazil\" }].filter(\n  sift({ location: { $in: [\"Costa Rica\", \"Brazil\"] } })\n);\n```\n\n### \\$nin\n\nOpposite of \\$in:\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: ['Haiti','Peru','Chile']\n[\"Brazil\", \"Haiti\", \"Peru\", \"Chile\"].filter(\n  sift({ $nin: [\"Costa Rica\", \"Brazil\"] })\n);\n```\n\n### \\$exists\n\nChecks if whether a value exists:\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: ['Craig','Tim']\nsift({ $exists: true })([\"Craig\", null, \"Tim\"]);\n```\n\nYou can also filter out values that don't exist\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [{ name: \"Tim\" }]\n[{ name: \"Craig\", city: \"Minneapolis\" }, { name: \"Tim\" }].filter(\n  sift({ city: { $exists: false } })\n);\n```\n\n### \\$gte\n\nChecks if a number is >= value:\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [2, 3]\n[0, 1, 2, 3].filter(sift({ $gte: 2 }));\n```\n\n### \\$gt\n\nChecks if a number is > value:\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [3]\n[0, 1, 2, 3].filter(sift({ $gt: 2 }));\n```\n\n### \\$lte\n\nChecks if a number is <= value.\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [0, 1, 2]\n[0, 1, 2, 3].filter(sift({ $lte: 2 }));\n```\n\n### \\$lt\n\nChecks if number is < value.\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [0, 1]\n[0, 1, 2, 3].filter(sift({ $lt: 2 }));\n```\n\n### \\$eq\n\nChecks if `query === value`. Note that **\\$eq can be omitted**. For **\\$eq**, and **\\$ne**\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [{ state: 'MN' }]\n[{ state: \"MN\" }, { state: \"CA\" }, { state: \"WI\" }].filter(\n  sift({ state: { $eq: \"MN\" } })\n);\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [{ state: 'MN' }]\n[{ state: \"MN\" }, { state: \"CA\" }, { state: \"WI\" }].filter(\n  sift({ state: \"MN\" })\n);\n```\n\n### \\$ne\n\nChecks if `query !== value`.\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [{ state: 'CA' }, { state: 'WI'}]\n[{ state: \"MN\" }, { state: \"CA\" }, { state: \"WI\" }].filter(\n  sift({ state: { $ne: \"MN\" } })\n);\n```\n\n### \\$mod\n\nModulus:\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [300, 600]\n[100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600].filter(sift({ $mod: [3, 0] }));\n```\n\n### \\$all\n\nvalues must match **everything** in array:\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [ { tags: ['books','programming','travel' ]} ]\n[\n  { tags: [\"books\", \"programming\", \"travel\"] },\n  { tags: [\"travel\", \"cooking\"] }\n].filter(sift({ tags: { $all: [\"books\", \"programming\"] } }));\n```\n\n### \\$and\n\nability to use an array of expressions. All expressions must test true.\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [ { name: 'Craig', state: 'MN' }]\n\n[\n  { name: \"Craig\", state: \"MN\" },\n  { name: \"Tim\", state: \"MN\" },\n  { name: \"Joe\", state: \"CA\" }\n].filter(sift({ $and: [{ name: \"Craig\" }, { state: \"MN\" }] }));\n```\n\n### \\$or\n\nOR array of expressions.\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [ { name: 'Craig', state: 'MN' }, { name: 'Tim', state: 'MN' }]\n[\n  { name: \"Craig\", state: \"MN\" },\n  { name: \"Tim\", state: \"MN\" },\n  { name: \"Joe\", state: \"CA\" }\n].filter(sift({ $or: [{ name: \"Craig\" }, { state: \"MN\" }] }));\n```\n\n### \\$nor\n\nopposite of or:\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: [{ name: 'Joe', state: 'CA' }]\n[\n  { name: \"Craig\", state: \"MN\" },\n  { name: \"Tim\", state: \"MN\" },\n  { name: \"Joe\", state: \"CA\" }\n].filter(sift({ $nor: [{ name: \"Craig\" }, { state: \"MN\" }] }));\n```\n\n### \\$size\n\nMatches an array - must match given size:\n\n```javascript\n//filtered: ['food','cooking']\n[{ tags: [\"food\", \"cooking\"] }, { tags: [\"traveling\"] }].filter(\n  sift({ tags: { $size: 2 } })\n);\n```\n\n### \\$type\n\nMatches a values based on the type\n\n```javascript\n[new Date(), 4342, \"hello world\"].filter(sift({ $type: Date })); //returns single date\n[new Date(), 4342, \"hello world\"].filter(sift({ $type: String })); //returns ['hello world']\n```\n\n### \\$regex\n\nMatches values based on the given regular expression\n\n```javascript\n[\"frank\", \"fred\", \"sam\", \"frost\"].filter(\n  sift({ $regex: /^f/i, $nin: [\"frank\"] })\n); // [\"fred\", \"frost\"]\n[\"frank\", \"fred\", \"sam\", \"frost\"].filter(\n  sift({ $regex: \"^f\", $options: \"i\", $nin: [\"frank\"] })\n); // [\"fred\", \"frost\"]\n```\n\n### \\$where\n\nMatches based on some javascript comparison\n\n```javascript\n[{ name: \"frank\" }, { name: \"joe\" }].filter(\n  sift({ $where: \"this.name === 'frank'\" })\n); // [\"frank\"]\n[{ name: \"frank\" }, { name: \"joe\" }].filter(\n  sift({\n    $where: function() {\n      return this.name === \"frank\";\n    }\n  })\n); // [\"frank\"]\n```\n\n### \\$elemMatch\n\nMatches elements of array\n\n```javascript\nvar bills = [\n  {\n    month: \"july\",\n    casts: [\n      {\n        id: 1,\n        value: 200\n      },\n      {\n        id: 2,\n        value: 1000\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    month: \"august\",\n    casts: [\n      {\n        id: 3,\n        value: 1000\n      },\n      {\n        id: 4,\n        value: 4000\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n];\n\nvar result = bills.filter(\n  sift({\n    casts: {\n      $elemMatch: {\n        value: { $gt: 1000 }\n      }\n    }\n  })\n); // {month:'august', casts:[{id:3, value: 1000},{id: 4, value: 4000}]}\n```\n\n### \\$not\n\nNot expression:\n\n```javascript\n[\"craig\", \"tim\", \"jake\"].filter(sift({ $not: { $in: [\"craig\", \"tim\"] } })); //['jake']\n[\"craig\", \"tim\", \"jake\"].filter(sift({ $not: { $size: 5 } })); //['tim','jake']\n```\n\n### Date comparison\n\nMongodb allows you to do date comparisons like so:\n\n```javascript\ndb.collection.find({ createdAt: { $gte: \"2018-03-22T06:00:00Z\" } });\n```\n\nIn Sift, you'll need to specify a Date object:\n\n```javascript\ncollection.find(\n  sift({ createdAt: { $gte: new Date(\"2018-03-22T06:00:00Z\") } })\n);\n```\n\n## Custom behavior\n\nSift works like MongoDB out of the box, but you're also able to modify the behavior to suite your needs.\n\n#### Custom operations\n\nYou can register your own custom operations. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nimport sift, { createEqualsOperation } from \"sift\";\n\nvar filter = sift(\n  {\n    $customMod: 2\n  },\n  {\n    operations: {\n      $customMod(params, ownerQuery, options) {\n        return createEqualsOperation(\n          value => value % params !== 0,\n          ownerQuery,\n          options\n        );\n      }\n    }\n  }\n);\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].filter(filter); // 1, 3, 5\n```\n\n#### Omitting built-in operations\n\nYou can create a filter function that omits the built-in operations like so:\n\n```javascript\nimport { createQueryTester, $in, $all, $nin, $lt } from \"sift\";\nconst test = createQueryTester(\n  {\n    $eq: 10\n  },\n  { operations: { $in, $all, $nin, $lt } }\n);\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 10].filter(test);\n```\n\nFor bundlers like `Webpack` and `Rollup`, operations that aren't used are omitted from application bundles via tree-shaking."

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."
