Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7.

"agent-base@6.0.2","agent-base","6.0.2","Turn a function into an `http.Agent` instance","MIT","Copyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;","agent-base ========== ### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance [![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/actions?workflow=Node+CI)  This module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.  #### Some subclasses:  Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`. Send a pull request to list yours!   * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints  * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints  * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS  * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install agent-base ```   Example -------  Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):  ```js var net = require('net'); var tls = require('tls'); var url = require('url'); var http = require('http'); var agent = require('agent-base');  var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/'; var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);  // This is the important part! parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {   var socket;   // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module   if (opts.secureEndpoint) {     socket = tls.connect(opts);   } else {     socket = net.connect(opts);   }   return socket; });  // Everything else works just like normal... http.get(parsed, function (res) {   console.log(''response' event!', res.headers);   res.pipe(process.stdout); }); ```  Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:  ```js agent(async function (req, opts) {   await sleep(1000);   // etc… }); ```  Return another `http.Agent` instance to 'pass through' the responsibility for that HTTP request to that agent:  ```js agent(function (req, opts) {   return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent; }); ```   API ---  ## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]  Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback` for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.  The `options` object accepts the following properties:    * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).  The callback function should have the following signature:  ### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined  The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will continue to proceed.  If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the `secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE ==========================  Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.  In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.  All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for the Open Source Definition).

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute     a modified version without making your changes open source.  The     GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with     other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.  (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,     because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to     CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1     is 'not incompatible' with the GPL.  Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to make these releases possible.   B.

"assert-plus@1.0.0","assert-plus","1.0.0","Extra assertions on top of node's assert module","MIT","","# assert-plus  This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable NODE\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like `assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks like this:  ```javascript     var assert = require('assert-plus');      function fooAccount(options, callback) {         assert.object(options, 'options');         assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');         assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');         assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');         assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');         assert.func(callback, 'callback');          // Do stuff         callback(null, {});     } ```  # API  All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError` will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:      AssertionError: foo (string) is required     at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)     at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)     at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)     at Object..js (module.js:464:10)     at Module.load (module.js:353:31)     at Function._load (module.js:311:12)     at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)     at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)  from:  ```javascript     function test(foo) {         assert.string(foo, 'foo');     } ```  There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:  ```javascript     function test(foo) {         assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');     } ```  You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):  ```javascript     assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo'); ```  Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from the `assert` module avoids this behavior.  The complete list of APIs is:  * assert.array * assert.bool * assert.buffer * assert.func * assert.number * assert.finite * assert.object * assert.string * assert.stream * assert.date * assert.regexp * assert.uuid * assert.arrayOfArray * assert.arrayOfBool * assert.arrayOfBuffer * assert.arrayOfFunc * assert.arrayOfNumber * assert.arrayOfFinite * assert.arrayOfObject * assert.arrayOfString * assert.arrayOfStream * assert.arrayOfDate * assert.arrayOfRegexp * assert.arrayOfUuid * assert.optionalArray * assert.optionalBool * assert.optionalBuffer * assert.optionalFunc * assert.optionalNumber * assert.optionalFinite * assert.optionalObject * assert.optionalString * assert.optionalStream * assert.optionalDate * assert.optionalRegexp * assert.optionalUuid * assert.optionalArrayOfArray * assert.optionalArrayOfBool * assert.optionalArrayOfBuffer * assert.optionalArrayOfFunc * assert.optionalArrayOfNumber * assert.optionalArrayOfFinite * assert.optionalArrayOfObject * assert.optionalArrayOfString * assert.optionalArrayOfStream * assert.optionalArrayOfDate * assert.optionalArrayOfRegexp * assert.optionalArrayOfUuid * assert.AssertionError * assert.fail * assert.ok * assert.equal * assert.notEqual * assert.deepEqual * assert.notDeepEqual * assert.strictEqual * assert.notStrictEqual * assert.throws * assert.doesNotThrow * assert.ifError  # Installation      npm install assert-plus  ## License  The MIT License (MIT) Copyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"filelist@1.0.4","filelist","1.0.4","Lazy-evaluating list of files, based on globs or regex patterns","Apache-2.0","","## FileList  A FileList is a lazy-evaluated list of files. When given a list of glob patterns for possible files to be included in the file list, instead of searching the file structures to find the files, a FileList holds the pattern for latter use.  This allows you to define a FileList to match any number of files, but only search out the actual files when then FileList itself is actually used. The key is that the first time an element of the FileList/Array is requested, the pending patterns are resolved into a real list of file names.  ### Usage  Add files to the list with the `include` method. You can add glob patterns, individual files, or RegExp objects. When the Array methods are invoked on the FileList, these items are resolved to an actual list of files.  ```javascript var fl = new FileList(); fl.include('test/*.js'); fl.exclude('test/helpers.js'); ```  Use the `exclude` method to override inclusions. You can use this when your inclusions are too broad.  ### Array methods  FileList has lazy-evaluated versions of most of the array methods, including the following:  * join * pop * push * concat * reverse * shift * unshift * slice * splice * sort * filter * forEach * some * every * map * indexOf * lastIndexOf * reduce * reduceRight  When you call one of these methods, the items in the FileList will be resolved to the full list of files, and the method will be invoked on that result.  ### Special `length` method  `length`: FileList includes a length *method* (instead of a property) which returns the number of actual files in the list once it's been resolved.  ### FileList-specific methods  `include`: Add a filename/glob/regex to the list  `exclude`: Override inclusions by excluding a filename/glob/regex  `resolve`: Resolve the items in the FileList to the full list of files. This method is invoked automatically when one of the array methods is called.  `toArray`: Immediately resolves the list of items, and returns an actual array of filepaths.  `clearInclusions`: Clears any pending items -- must be used before resolving the list.  `clearExclusions`: Clears the list of exclusions rules.","undefined","undefined"

"https-proxy-agent@5.0.1","https-proxy-agent","5.0.1","An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS","MIT","Copyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;","https-proxy-agent ================ ### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS [![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)  This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.  Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary 'proxy' server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.  Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets). See the 'Examples' section below for more.   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install https-proxy-agent ```   Examples --------  #### `https` module example  ``` js var url = require('url'); var https = require('https'); var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');  // HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128'; console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);  // HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate'; console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint); var options = url.parse(endpoint);  // create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy); options.agent = agent;  https.get(options, function (res) {   console.log(''response' event!', res.headers);   res.pipe(process.stdout); }); ```  #### `ws` WebSocket connection example  ``` js var url = require('url'); var WebSocket = require('ws'); var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');  // HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128'; console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);  // WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org'; var parsed = url.parse(endpoint); console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);  // create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information var options = url.parse(proxy);  var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);  // finally, initiate the WebSocket connection var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });  socket.on('open', function () {   console.log(''open' event!');   socket.send('hello world'); });  socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {   console.log(''message' event! %j %j', data, flags);   socket.close(); }); ```  API ---  ### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)  The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects to the specified 'HTTP(s) proxy server' in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].  The `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an 'options' object with more specific properties:    * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.   * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.   * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.   * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.   * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.

Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the following:  a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;  b) to prepare derivative works ('Derivative Works') based upon the Original Work;  c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public;  d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and  e) to display the Original Work publicly.  2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works.  3) Grant of Source Code License. The term 'Source Code' means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.  4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.  5) This section intentionally omitted.  6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an 'Attribution Notice.' You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.  7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an 'AS IS' BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.  8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.  9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.  10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.  11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Â§ 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License.  12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.  13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.  14) Definition of 'You' in This License. 'You' throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, 'You' includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, 'control' means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.  15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.  This license is Copyright (C) 2003-2004 Lawrence E. Rosen. All rights reserved. Permission is hereby granted to copy and distribute this license without modification.

If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:  You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and  You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and  You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and  If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"sift@16.0.1","sift","16.0.1","MongoDB query filtering in JavaScript","MIT","","**Installation**: `npm install sift`, or `yarn add sift`  ## Sift is a tiny library for using MongoDB queries in Javascript  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/crcn/sift.js.png)](https://secure.travis-ci.org/crcn/sift.js)  <!-- [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/crcn/sift.js/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/crcn/sift.js)  --> <!-- [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/crcn/sift.js](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/crcn/sift.js?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) -->  **For extended documentation, checkout http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/query/**  ## Features:  - Supported operators: [\$in](#in), [\$nin](#nin), [\$exists](#exists), [\$gte](#gte), [\$gt](#gt), [\$lte](#lte), [\$lt](#lt), [\$eq](#eq), [\$ne](#ne), [\$mod](#mod), [\$all](#all), [\$and](#and), [\$or](#or), [\$nor](#nor), [\$not](#not), [\$size](#size), [\$type](#type), [\$regex](#regex), [\$where](#where), [\$elemMatch](#elemmatch) - Regexp searches - Supports node.js, and web - Custom Operations - Tree-shaking (omitting functionality from web app bundles)  ## Examples  ```javascript import sift from 'sift';  //intersecting arrays const result1 = ['hello', 'sifted', 'array!'].filter(   sift({ $in: ['hello', 'world'] }) ); //['hello']  //regexp filter const result2 = ['craig', 'john', 'jake'].filter(sift(/^j/)); //['john','jake']  // function filter const testFilter = sift({   //you can also filter against functions   name: function(value) {     return value.length == 5;   } });  const result3 = [   {     name: 'craig'   },   {     name: 'john'   },   {     name: 'jake'   } ].filter(testFilter); // filtered: [{ name: 'craig' }]  //you can test *single values* against your custom sifter testFilter({ name: 'sarah' }); //true testFilter({ name: 'tim' }); //false ```  ## API  ### sift(query: MongoQuery, options?: Options): Function  Creates a filter with all of the built-in MongoDB query operations.  - `query` - the filter to use against the target array - `options`   - `operations` - [custom operations](#custom-operations)   - `compare` - compares difference between two values  Example:  ```javascript import sift from 'sift';  const test = sift({ $gt: 5 }));  console.log(test(6)); // true console.log(test(4)); // false  [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].filter(sift({ $exists: true })); // [6, 7] ```  ### createQueryTester(query: Query, options?: Options): Function  Creates a filter function **without** built-in MongoDB query operations. This is useful if you're looking to omit certain operations from application bundles. See [Omitting built-in operations](#omitting-built-in-operations) for more info.  ```javascript import { createQueryTester, $eq, $in } from 'sift'; const filter = createQueryTester({ $eq: 5 }, { operations: { $eq, $in } }); ```  ### createEqualsOperation(params: any, ownerQuery: Query, options: Options): Operation  Used for [custom operations](#custom-operations).  ```javascript import { createQueryTester, createEqualsOperation, $eq, $in } from 'sift'; const filter = createQueryTester(   { $mod: 5 },   {     operations: {       $something(mod, ownerQuery, options) {         return createEqualsOperation(           value => value % mod === 0,           ownerQuery,           options         );       }     }   } ); filter(10); // true filter(11); // false ```  ## Supported Operators  See MongoDB's [advanced queries](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Advanced+Queries) for more info.  ### \$in  array value must be _\$in_ the given query:  Intersecting two arrays:  ```javascript //filtered: ['Brazil'] ['Brazil', 'Haiti', 'Peru', 'Chile'].filter(   sift({ $in: ['Costa Rica', 'Brazil'] }) ); ```  Here's another example. This acts more like the \$or operator:  ```javascript [{ name: 'Craig', location: 'Brazil' }].filter(   sift({ location: { $in: ['Costa Rica', 'Brazil'] } }) ); ```  ### \$nin  Opposite of \$in:  ```javascript //filtered: ['Haiti','Peru','Chile'] ['Brazil', 'Haiti', 'Peru', 'Chile'].filter(   sift({ $nin: ['Costa Rica', 'Brazil'] }) ); ```  ### \$exists  Checks if whether a value exists:  ```javascript //filtered: ['Craig','Tim'] sift({ $exists: true })(['Craig', null, 'Tim']); ```  You can also filter out values that don't exist  ```javascript //filtered: [{ name: 'Tim' }] [{ name: 'Craig', city: 'Minneapolis' }, { name: 'Tim' }].filter(   sift({ city: { $exists: false } }) ); ```  ### \$gte  Checks if a number is >= value:  ```javascript //filtered: [2, 3] [0, 1, 2, 3].filter(sift({ $gte: 2 })); ```  ### \$gt  Checks if a number is > value:  ```javascript //filtered: [3] [0, 1, 2, 3].filter(sift({ $gt: 2 })); ```  ### \$lte  Checks if a number is <= value.  ```javascript //filtered: [0, 1, 2] [0, 1, 2, 3].filter(sift({ $lte: 2 })); ```  ### \$lt  Checks if number is < value.  ```javascript //filtered: [0, 1] [0, 1, 2, 3].filter(sift({ $lt: 2 })); ```  ### \$eq  Checks if `query === value`. Note that **\$eq can be omitted**. For **\$eq**, and **\$ne**  ```javascript //filtered: [{ state: 'MN' }] [{ state: 'MN' }, { state: 'CA' }, { state: 'WI' }].filter(   sift({ state: { $eq: 'MN' } }) ); ```  Or:  ```javascript //filtered: [{ state: 'MN' }] [{ state: 'MN' }, { state: 'CA' }, { state: 'WI' }].filter(   sift({ state: 'MN' }) ); ```  ### \$ne  Checks if `query !== value`.  ```javascript //filtered: [{ state: 'CA' }, { state: 'WI'}] [{ state: 'MN' }, { state: 'CA' }, { state: 'WI' }].filter(   sift({ state: { $ne: 'MN' } }) ); ```  ### \$mod  Modulus:  ```javascript //filtered: [300, 600] [100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600].filter(sift({ $mod: [3, 0] })); ```  ### \$all  values must match **everything** in array:  ```javascript //filtered: [ { tags: ['books','programming','travel' ]} ] [   { tags: ['books', 'programming', 'travel'] },   { tags: ['travel', 'cooking'] } ].filter(sift({ tags: { $all: ['books', 'programming'] } })); ```  ### \$and  ability to use an array of expressions. All expressions must test true.  ```javascript //filtered: [ { name: 'Craig', state: 'MN' }]  [   { name: 'Craig', state: 'MN' },   { name: 'Tim', state: 'MN' },   { name: 'Joe', state: 'CA' } ].filter(sift({ $and: [{ name: 'Craig' }, { state: 'MN' }] })); ```  ### \$or  OR array of expressions.  ```javascript //filtered: [ { name: 'Craig', state: 'MN' }, { name: 'Tim', state: 'MN' }] [   { name: 'Craig', state: 'MN' },   { name: 'Tim', state: 'MN' },   { name: 'Joe', state: 'CA' } ].filter(sift({ $or: [{ name: 'Craig' }, { state: 'MN' }] })); ```  ### \$nor  opposite of or:  ```javascript //filtered: [{ name: 'Joe', state: 'CA' }] [   { name: 'Craig', state: 'MN' },   { name: 'Tim', state: 'MN' },   { name: 'Joe', state: 'CA' } ].filter(sift({ $nor: [{ name: 'Craig' }, { state: 'MN' }] })); ```  ### \$size  Matches an array - must match given size:  ```javascript //filtered: ['food','cooking'] [{ tags: ['food', 'cooking'] }, { tags: ['traveling'] }].filter(   sift({ tags: { $size: 2 } }) ); ```  ### \$type  Matches a values based on the type  ```javascript [new Date(), 4342, 'hello world'].filter(sift({ $type: Date })); //returns single date [new Date(), 4342, 'hello world'].filter(sift({ $type: String })); //returns ['hello world'] ```  ### \$regex  Matches values based on the given regular expression  ```javascript ['frank', 'fred', 'sam', 'frost'].filter(   sift({ $regex: /^f/i, $nin: ['frank'] }) ); // ['fred', 'frost'] ['frank', 'fred', 'sam', 'frost'].filter(   sift({ $regex: '^f', $options: 'i', $nin: ['frank'] }) ); // ['fred', 'frost'] ```  ### \$where  Matches based on some javascript comparison  ```javascript [{ name: 'frank' }, { name: 'joe' }].filter(   sift({ $where: 'this.name === 'frank'' }) ); // ['frank'] [{ name: 'frank' }, { name: 'joe' }].filter(   sift({     $where: function() {       return this.name === 'frank';     }   }) ); // ['frank'] ```  ### \$elemMatch  Matches elements of array  ```javascript var bills = [   {     month: 'july',     casts: [       {         id: 1,         value: 200       },       {         id: 2,         value: 1000       }     ]   },   {     month: 'august',     casts: [       {         id: 3,         value: 1000       },       {         id: 4,         value: 4000       }     ]   } ];  var result = bills.filter(   sift({     casts: {       $elemMatch: {         value: { $gt: 1000 }       }     }   }) ); // {month:'august', casts:[{id:3, value: 1000},{id: 4, value: 4000}]} ```  ### \$not  Not expression:  ```javascript ['craig', 'tim', 'jake'].filter(sift({ $not: { $in: ['craig', 'tim'] } })); //['jake'] ['craig', 'tim', 'jake'].filter(sift({ $not: { $size: 5 } })); //['tim','jake'] ```  ### Date comparison  Mongodb allows you to do date comparisons like so:  ```javascript db.collection.find({ createdAt: { $gte: '2018-03-22T06:00:00Z' } }); ```  In Sift, you'll need to specify a Date object:  ```javascript collection.find(   sift({ createdAt: { $gte: new Date('2018-03-22T06:00:00Z') } }) ); ```  ## Custom behavior  Sift works like MongoDB out of the box, but you're also able to modify the behavior to suite your needs.  #### Custom operations  You can register your own custom operations. Here's an example:  ```javascript import sift, { createEqualsOperation } from 'sift';  var filter = sift(   {     $customMod: 2   },   {     operations: {       $customMod(params, ownerQuery, options) {         return createEqualsOperation(           value => value % params !== 0,           ownerQuery,           options         );       }     }   } );  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].filter(filter); // 1, 3, 5 ```  #### Omitting built-in operations  You can create a filter function that omits the built-in operations like so:  ```javascript import { createQueryTester, $in, $all, $nin, $lt } from 'sift'; const test = createQueryTester(   {     $eq: 10   },   { operations: { $in, $all, $nin, $lt } } );  [1, 2, 3, 4, 10].filter(test); ```  For bundlers like `Webpack` and `Rollup`, operations that aren't used are omitted from application bundles via tree-shaking.","undefined","undefined"

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Works with [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [Restify](http://restify.com/), or any other [Connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect) app.  - [How to Use](#use) - [Testing & Contributing](#testing)  <a name='use'></a> ## How to Use ```bash npm install xss-clean --save ``` ```javascript var restify = require('restify') var xss = require('xss-clean')  var app = restify.createServer()  app.use(restify.bodyParser())  /* make sure this comes before any routes */ app.use(xss())  app.listen(8080) ```  This will sanitize any data in `req.body`, `req.query`, and `req.params`. You can also access the API directly if you don't want to use as middleware.  ```javascript var clean = require('xss-clean/lib/xss').clean  var cleaned = clean('<script></script>') // will return '&lt;script>&lt;/script>' ```  <a name='testing'></a> ## Testing & Contributing ```bash npm install npm test ```  If you want to contribute or come across an issue that you know how to fix, [just do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0).","undefined","undefined"
